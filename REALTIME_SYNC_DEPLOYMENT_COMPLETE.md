# Dispatcher App Deployment to Vercel - Complete Guide

## Current Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✅

The dispatcher app has been fully prepared for Vercel deployment with all necessary configurations and real-time synchronization capabilities.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 2. Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

### 3. Deploy from dispatcher_app directory
```bash
cd "/Volumes/C/CCT APPS/dispatcher_app"
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
After deployment, go to your Vercel project dashboard and add these environment variables:

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://btzfgasugkycbavcwvnx.supabase.co`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ0emZnYXN1Z2t5Y2JhdmN3dm54Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDQ2MzcwOTIsImV4cCI6MjA2MDIxMzA5Mn0.FQtQXKvkBLVtmCqShLyg_y9EDPrufyWQnbD8EE25zSU`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ0emZnYXN1Z2t5Y2JhdmN3dm54Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDYzNzA5MiwiZXhwIjoyMDYwMjEzMDkyfQ.kyMoPfYsqEXPkCBqe8Au435teJA0Q3iQFEMt4wDR_yA`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = `AIzaSyDylwCsypHOs6T9e-JnTA7AoqOMrc3hbhE`

### 5. Set Database Permissions
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Execute the fix-dispatcher-permissions.sql file
-- This ensures the dispatcher app can read and update trips
```
