## ðŸ“Š **PRICING MODEL COMPLETE**

The comprehensive pricing model has been successfully implemented in the Facility App with all the specifications you provided.

---

## ðŸ’° **Pricing Structure**

### **Base Rates**
- **One-way trip:** $50.00
- **Round trip:** $100.00

### **Distance Pricing**
- **Per mile charge:** $3.00 per mile
- **Calculation:** Using Google Maps API (with fallback estimation)
- **Applied to:** Each leg of the journey (round trips = 2x distance charge)

### **Time-based Premiums**
- **Off-hours premium:** $40.00 additional
  - Applied for trips before 8:00 AM or after 8:00 PM
- **Weekend premium:** $40.00 additional
  - Applied for trips on Saturday or Sunday

### **Special Requirements**
- **Wheelchair accessibility:** $25.00 additional charge

### **Discounts**
- **Individual client discount:** 10% automatic discount
  - Applied to the subtotal before final calculation

---

## ðŸ§® **Calculation Formula**

```
Total Price = (Base Rate + (Distance Charge Ã— Number of Legs) + Time Premiums + Special Requirements) - Applicable Discounts
```

### **Example Calculations:**

**Example 1: Basic One-Way Trip**
- Base Rate: $50.00
- Distance: 8 miles Ã— $3.00 = $24.00
- Time: 2:00 PM (no premium)
- Special: No wheelchair
- Client: Facility client (no discount)
- **Total: $74.00**

**Example 2: Round Trip with Premiums**
- Base Rate: $100.00
- Distance: 12 miles Ã— $3.00 Ã— 2 legs = $72.00
- Time: 9:30 PM = $40.00 (off-hours)
- Day: Saturday = $40.00 (weekend)
- Special: Wheelchair = $25.00
- Client: Individual = 10% discount
- Subtotal: $277.00
- Discount: $27.70
- **Total: $249.30**
