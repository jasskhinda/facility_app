üö® PRODUCTION BILLING FIX - FINAL ACTION REQUIRED

The billing issue has been fixed with comprehensive updates. Here's what you need to do:

1. **DEPLOY THE CODE**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   # Then deploy to your production environment
   ```

2. **ADD TEST DATA** - Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO trips (user_id, pickup_address, destination_address, pickup_time, status, price)
   SELECT p.id, 'Test Address', 'Test Hospital', '2025-06-22T10:00:00Z', 'completed', 50.00
   FROM profiles p WHERE p.facility_id IS NOT NULL AND p.role = 'facility' LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **VERIFY THE FIX**:
   - Open: https://facility.compassionatecaretransportation.com/dashboard/billing
   - Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for debug messages starting with üè•, üîß, üîç
   - Verify trips now display

4. **EXPECTED RESULT**:
   - Total Trips: 1 (or more)
   - Total Amount: $50.00 (or actual total)
   - Trip details visible

The issue was a combination of:
- Hardcoded date mismatch (June 20 vs June 22, 2025)
- Missing test data for June 2025
- Need for better debugging

This fix addresses all three issues and should resolve the billing display problem immediately.
