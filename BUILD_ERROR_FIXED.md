# 🔧 BUILD ERROR FIXED - Duplicate Import Removed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `Identifier 'createRouteHandlerClient' has already been declared`
**Location**: `/app/api/facility/clients/[id]/route.js`
**Cause**: Duplicate import statement on lines 1 and 2

## 🔧 Fix Applied

**Before**:
```javascript
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@/lib/route-handler-client';
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@/lib/route-handler-client'; // DUPLICATE
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
```

**After**:
```javascript
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@/lib/route-handler-client';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
```

## ✅ Status

- **Local Syntax Check**: ✅ Passed
- **Git Committed**: ✅ Complete  
- **Pushed to GitHub**: ✅ Complete
- **Vercel Deployment**: 🔄 In Progress

## 🚀 Expected Result

The next Vercel deployment should:
1. ✅ Build successfully without webpack errors
2. ✅ Deploy the CLIENT VIEW/EDIT fixes
3. ✅ Enable working client detail and edit pages

## 🧪 Once Deployed, Test:

1. **Client View**: https://facility.compassionatecaretransportation.com/dashboard/clients/72a44be8-8e3b-4626-854e-39d5ea79223a
2. **Client Edit**: https://facility.compassionatecaretransportation.com/dashboard/clients/72a44be8-8e3b-4626-854e-39d5ea79223a/edit

Both pages should now load and work correctly! 🎉

## 📝 Technical Details

The duplicate import was accidentally introduced during the debugging enhancement process. The webpack bundler detected this as a redeclaration error during the production build process, even though it would have worked in development mode.

This fix ensures:
- ✅ Clean production builds
- ✅ Proper module importing
- ✅ Client VIEW/EDIT functionality restored
