# 🎉 WHEELCHAIR BOOKING FLOW - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The professional wheelchair booking flow has been **fully implemented** across the facility app with all requirements met, including **transport wheelchair safety restrictions**.

## 🛡️ TRANSPORT WHEELCHAIR SAFETY FEATURE ADDED

**New Safety Requirement Implemented**: Transport wheelchairs are now properly restricted due to safety regulations.

**Safety Features**:
- ✅ **Professional Safety Notice**: Clear amber warning box when transport wheelchair selected
- ✅ **Visual "Not Available" Indicator**: Transport wheelchair option shows amber styling with "Not Available" badge
- ✅ **Form Validation**: All booking forms prevent submission when transport wheelchair selected
- ✅ **Professional Error Messages**: Clear explanation of safety regulations and alternative options
- ✅ **User Guidance**: Suggests alternative wheelchair options or facility-provided accommodation

## 🐛 INFINITE LOOP BUG FIXED

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed infinite re-rendering caused by `useEffect` dependency on `onWheelchairChange` function.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed `onWheelchairChange` from useEffect dependencies in `WheelchairSelectionFlow.js`
- Added `useCallback` to all `handleWheelchairChange` functions in booking forms
- Properly memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `app/components/WheelchairSelectionFlow.js` - Fixed infinite loop in useEffect
- ✅ `app/components/BookingForm.js` - Added useCallback to handleWheelchairChange
- ✅ `app/components/FacilityBookingForm.js` - Added useCallback to handleWheelchairChange  
- ✅ `app/components/StreamlinedBookingForm.js` - Added useCallback + useCallback import

## 📋 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Component Structure
```javascript
// WheelchairSelectionFlow.js - PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED + SAFETY ENHANCED
- Radio button interface for wheelchair types
- Conditional "provide wheelchair" option
- Custom type input field
- Real-time pricing display
- Professional UI with accessibility info
- Fixed useEffect dependencies to prevent infinite loops
- Transport wheelchair safety notice with amber styling
- "Not Available" badge for transport wheelchair option
```

### Safety Logic
```javascript
// Enhanced wheelchair data object:
const wheelchairData = {
  type: wheelchairType,
  needsProvided: needsWheelchair,
  customType: customWheelchairType,
  hasWheelchairFee: hasValidWheelchair,
  fee: hasValidWheelchair ? WHEELCHAIR_PRICE : 0,
  isTransportChair: isTransportChair,        // NEW: Safety flag
  isValidSelection: !isTransportChair        // NEW: Validation flag
};
```

### Form Integration Pattern
```javascript
// Added to all booking forms with performance optimization + safety:
const handleWheelchairChange = useCallback((newWheelchairData) => {
  // Updates state and triggers pricing recalculation
  // Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
}, [dependencies]);

// Transport wheelchair validation in handleSubmit:
if (wheelchairData.isTransportChair) {
  setError('We are unable to accommodate transport wheelchairs due to safety regulations...');
  return;
}
```

### Database Enhancement
```javascript
// Trip creation uses existing wheelchair_type column:
wheelchair_type: wheelchairData.isTransportChair ? 'transport_not_allowed' : 
                wheelchairData.needsProvided ? 'provided' : 
                wheelchairData.type === 'none' ? 'no_wheelchair' : 
                wheelchairData.type
// Note: Fixed to use existing schema without requiring new columns
```
