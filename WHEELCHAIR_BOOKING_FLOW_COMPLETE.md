# 🎉 WHEELCHAIR BOOKING FLOW - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The professional wheelchair booking flow has been **fully implemented** across the facility app with all requirements met.

## 🐛 INFINITE LOOP BUG FIXED

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed infinite re-rendering caused by `useEffect` dependency on `onWheelchairChange` function.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed `onWheelchairChange` from useEffect dependencies in `WheelchairSelectionFlow.js`
- Added `useCallback` to all `handleWheelchairChange` functions in booking forms
- Properly memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `app/components/WheelchairSelectionFlow.js` - Fixed infinite loop in useEffect
- ✅ `app/components/BookingForm.js` - Added useCallback to handleWheelchairChange
- ✅ `app/components/FacilityBookingForm.js` - Added useCallback to handleWheelchairChange  
- ✅ `app/components/StreamlinedBookingForm.js` - Added useCallback + useCallback import
