# Route Map Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for verifying the complete integration of Google Maps route display and pricing calculations in the Compassionate Rides Facility App booking form.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Route Map Display
**Test:** Enter pickup and destination addresses in booking form
**Expected:** 
- Map appears below destination address input
- Shows both pickup and destination markers
- Displays route between locations
- Shows distance and travel time information

### 2. Pricing Integration with Route Data
**Test:** Complete address entry and verify pricing updates
**Expected:**
- Pricing calculation uses actual route distance from map
- Price breakdown shows accurate distance-based charges
- Route information (distance, duration) appears in pricing summary
- Real-time updates as addresses change

### 3. Booking Form Submission
**Test:** Complete booking with route information
**Expected:**
- Trip record saves route data (distance, duration, route text)
- Pricing information stored accurately
- Route information available for future reference

### 4. Fallback Handling
**Test:** Test with invalid addresses or API failures
**Expected:**
- Graceful fallback to distance estimation
- Error handling for invalid addresses
- User feedback for any issues

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Route Map Component** - `RouteMapDisplay.js` created with full Google Maps integration
