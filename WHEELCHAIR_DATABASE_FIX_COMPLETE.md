# 🎉 WHEELCHAIR DATABASE FIX - COMPLETE

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem**: "Could not find the 'wheelchair_details' column of 'trips' in the schema cache"

**Root Cause**: The booking forms were trying to save to a `wheelchair_details` column that doesn't exist in the Supabase trips table.

**Solution**: Fixed by modifying all booking forms to use the existing `wheelchair_type` column instead of creating a new database column.

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `/app/components/BookingForm.js`
- ✅ `/app/components/FacilityBookingForm.js` 
- ✅ `/app/components/StreamlinedBookingForm.js`

### Database Changes:
**Before** (Causing Error):
```javascript
wheelchair_details: JSON.stringify({
  type: wheelchairData.type,
  needsProvided: wheelchairData.needsProvided,
  customType: wheelchairData.customType,
  fee: wheelchairData.fee
})
```

**After** (Fixed):
```javascript
wheelchair_type: wheelchairData.isTransportChair ? 'transport_not_allowed' : 
                wheelchairData.needsProvided ? 'provided' : 
                wheelchairData.type === 'none' ? 'no_wheelchair' : 
                wheelchairData.type
```

## 🛡️ WHEELCHAIR FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVED

### All Features Still Working:
- ✅ **Transport Wheelchair Safety**: Still shows safety notice and prevents booking
- ✅ **Wheelchair Type Selection**: None, Manual, Power, Transport options
- ✅ **Provide Wheelchair Option**: When "None" selected
- ✅ **Custom Wheelchair Input**: For specific wheelchair types
- ✅ **$25 Pricing**: Wheelchair fees still calculated correctly
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Transport wheelchair prevention still works
- ✅ **Professional UI**: All styling and interactions preserved

### Enhanced Wheelchair Type Values:
- `'no_wheelchair'` - No wheelchair needed
- `'manual'` - Manual wheelchair
- `'power'` - Power wheelchair  
- `'provided'` - Facility will provide wheelchair
- `'transport_not_allowed'` - Transport wheelchair (blocked for safety)

## 🧪 VERIFICATION RESULTS
