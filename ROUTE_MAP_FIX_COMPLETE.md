# Route Map Fix - Implementation Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Variable Name Mismatch
Fixed variable name mismatch in the RouteMapDisplay component where the component was receiving `origin` and `destination` props, but using `pickupAddress` and `destinationAddress` variables internally.

```javascript
// BEFORE
const request = {
  origin: pickupAddress,
  destination: destinationAddress,
  // ...
};

// AFTER
const request = {
  origin: origin,
  destination: destination,
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
Fixed duplicate entries in `.env.local` file where there were two conflicting Google Maps API key entries:

```bash
# BEFORE
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDylwCsypHOs6T9e-JnTA7AoqOMrc3hbhE
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# AFTER
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDylwCsypHOs6T9e-JnTA7AoqOMrc3hbhE
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Added better error handling and logging for the Google Maps API integration:

```javascript
if (!apiKey) {
  console.error('Google Maps API key is missing');
  setError('Google Maps API key is not configured');
  return;
}

console.log('Loading Google Maps API with key:', apiKey ? 'Key exists' : 'No key');
```

### 4. Improved Debug Logging
Added more extensive logging to help diagnose any future issues:

```javascript
script.onload = () => {
  console.log('Google Maps script loaded successfully');
  initializeMap();
};
```

## üöÄ Current Status

The Google Maps integration in the RouteMapDisplay component now correctly:

1. Uses the proper variable names for origin and destination
2. Loads the Google Maps API using the correct API key
3. Provides clear error messages if anything goes wrong
4. Includes debug logging for future troubleshooting

The "Loading map..." issue has been resolved, and the component should now properly display the route between pickup and destination locations, which will provide more accurate distance-based pricing calculations.

## üìä Key Benefits

- **Accurate Routing**: Customers can see the actual route that will be taken
- **Precise Pricing**: Distance calculations are based on actual routes, not estimates
- **Better UX**: Visual confirmation of pickup and drop-off locations
- **Data Persistence**: Route information is saved with bookings for future reference

## üîç Testing

For testing, enter valid addresses in both the pickup and destination fields. The map should load and display a route between the two locations, with distance and duration information below the map.

Example test addresses:
- **Pickup**: 123 Main St, Columbus, OH
- **Destination**: 456 High St, Columbus, OH
