# üéØ WHEELCHAIR RENTAL PRICING IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Successfully updated the wheelchair pricing logic to distinguish between:
- **Bringing your own wheelchair** (manual/power) = **$0 additional fee**
- **Wheelchair rental** (CCT provides) = **$25 rental fee**

## üîß KEY CHANGES MADE

### 1. **Updated Pricing Logic** (`/lib/pricing.js`)

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
// Special requirements - wheelchair accessibility premium
if (wheelchairType === 'foldable' || wheelchairType === 'power') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR;
}
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
// Special requirements - wheelchair rental premium (only when CCT provides wheelchair)
if (wheelchairType === 'provided') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR;
}
```

### 2. **Updated Component Logic** (`/app/components/WheelchairSelectionFlow.js`)

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const hasValidWheelchair = (wheelchairType !== 'none' && wheelchairType !== 'transport') || needsWheelchair;
const hasWheelchairFee = hasValidWheelchair;
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
// Only charge fee when CCT provides wheelchair (rental), not when bringing own wheelchair
const hasWheelchairFee = needsWheelchair; // Only true when "Yes, please provide a wheelchair" is selected
```

## üìã PRICING BREAKDOWN

| Wheelchair Selection | Fee | Database Value | UI Display |
|---------------------|-----|----------------|------------|
| None | $0 | `no_wheelchair` | - |
| Manual (I have my own) | **$0** | `manual` | "No additional fee" |
| Power (I have my own) | **$0** | `power` | "No additional fee" |
| Yes, please provide wheelchair | **$25** | `provided` | "+$25 wheelchair rental fee" |
| Transport wheelchair | N/A | `transport_not_allowed` | "Not Available" (safety) |

## üéØ BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTED

### **Wheelchair Accessibility vs Rental Fee**
- **Accessibility**: All vehicles are wheelchair accessible (no extra charge)
- **Rental Fee**: Only charged when CCT provides the wheelchair equipment ($25)

### **User Experience**
- Clear distinction between "bringing your own" vs "rental"
- Transparent pricing with "No additional fee" messaging
- Professional UI that explains the fee structure

## üß™ VERIFICATION POINTS

### ‚úÖ Pricing Logic
- Only charges $25 when `wheelchairType === 'provided'`
- No charges for `manual` or `power` wheelchair types
- Existing pricing calculation flow preserved

### ‚úÖ Component Logic  
- `hasWheelchairFee` only true when `needsWheelchair = true`
- UI correctly shows "No additional fee" for own wheelchairs
- UI correctly shows "$25 rental fee" for provided wheelchairs

### ‚úÖ Database Integration
- Saves `'provided'` when CCT provides wheelchair
- Saves actual wheelchair type (`'manual'`, `'power'`) when user brings own
- Maintains existing database schema compatibility
