# Facility Owner Protection Implementation

## Overview
The facility owner protection system ensures that the main facility account holder (owner) maintains permanent Super Admin privileges and cannot be demoted or removed from the system.

## Key Features

### 1. Owner Identification
- The facility owner is identified as the earliest Super Admin user for each facility
- Owners are marked with an `is_owner` field in the `facility_users` table
- If no `is_owner` field exists, the system automatically identifies the earliest Super Admin as the owner

### 2. Owner Protection Rules
- **Role Protection**: Owner's role cannot be changed from Super Admin
- **Status Protection**: Owner cannot be deactivated or removed
- **Deletion Protection**: Owner cannot be deleted from the facility

### 3. Database Schema Changes

#### New Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE facility_users ADD COLUMN is_owner BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

#### Constraints
```sql
-- Ensure only one owner per facility
CONSTRAINT unique_facility_owner UNIQUE(facility_id) WHERE is_owner = TRUE;

-- Ensure owner is always super_admin
CONSTRAINT owner_must_be_super_admin CHECK (NOT is_owner OR role = 'super_admin');
```

#### Triggers
```sql
-- Protect facility owner from role changes
CREATE TRIGGER protect_facility_owner_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON facility_users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION protect_facility_owner();
```

### 4. Frontend Implementation

#### Visual Indicators
- Owner badge displayed next to user's role
- "Role locked (Owner)" message instead of role dropdown
- "Protected" message instead of remove button

#### Permission Logic
- Role change dropdown is hidden for owners
- Remove button is hidden for owners
- Owner status is clearly communicated in the UI

### 5. Current Implementation Status

#### âœ… Completed
- Database schema design with owner protection
- Frontend UI updates to show owner status
- Permission logic to prevent owner changes
- Automatic owner identification for existing data
- API protection (will fail gracefully if owner changes are attempted)

#### ðŸ”„ Pending Database Migration
The `is_owner` column needs to be added to the production database. Until then:
- The system uses automatic owner detection based on earliest Super Admin
- All protection logic is in place and will work once the column is added

### 6. Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Add Database Column
```sql
-- Run the migration script
\i facility_app/db/add_owner_field_migration.sql
```

#### Step 2: Verify Owner Assignment
```sql
-- Check that owners are correctly identified
SELECT 
    f.name as facility_name,
    p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as owner_name,
    p.email as owner_email,
    fu.role,
    fu.is_owner
FROM facility_users fu
JOIN facilities f ON fu.facility_id = f.id
JOIN profiles p ON fu.user_id = p.id
WHERE fu.is_owner = TRUE
ORDER BY f.name;
```

### 7. Owner Identification Logic

The system identifies facility owners using this priority:
1. User explicitly marked with `is_owner = TRUE`
2. If no owner exists, the earliest Super Admin user
3. If no Super Admin exists, the earliest user (promoted to Super Admin)

### 8. Error Handling

The system provides clear error messages when attempting to:
- Change owner's role: "Cannot change facility owner role from super_admin"
- Remove owner status: "Cannot remove owner status from facility owner"
- Deactivate owner: "Cannot deactivate facility owner"
- Delete owner: Prevented by RLS policy

### 9. Testing

#### Test Scenarios
1. âœ… Owner cannot change their own role
2. âœ… Other Super Admins cannot change owner's role
3. âœ… Owner cannot be removed from facility
4. âœ… Owner status is visually indicated in UI
5. âœ… New users can still be created normally

#### Test Commands
```bash
# Test user creation (should work)
node facility_app/test-api-logic.js

# Test owner identification
node facility_app/run-owner-migration.js
```

### 10. Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
- Owner transfer functionality (with proper authorization)
- Multiple owners per facility (if business requirements change)
- Owner succession planning (backup owners)
- Audit logging for owner-related actions

## Security Considerations

1. **Database Level**: Constraints and triggers prevent unauthorized changes
2. **API Level**: Server-side validation blocks owner modifications
3. **UI Level**: Interface prevents accidental owner changes
4. **RLS Policies**: Row-level security prevents owner deletion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Owner not showing**: Check if `is_owner` column exists and is populated
2. **Multiple owners**: Verify unique constraint is in place
3. **No owner identified**: Run the migration script to identify owners

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check current facility users
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('facility_users')
  .select('*, profiles(first_name, last_name, email)')
  .eq('facility_id', 'your-facility-id');

console.log('Facility users:', data);
```
