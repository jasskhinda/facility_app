   - Added `pricing_breakdown_locked_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Timestamp when breakdown was saved
   - **Status**: Successfully migrated ‚úÖ

2. **Booking Form Updates** ‚úÖ
   - **StreamlinedBookingForm.js** - Enhanced to save pricing breakdown data during trip creation
   - Captures complete pricing details including:
     - Base pricing breakdown
     - Distance and route information
     - County information
     - Client data (weight, bariatric status)
     - Holiday surcharge information
     - Booking source and timestamp

## üîÑ HOW IT WORKS

### **During Booking:**
1. User fills out booking form with trip details
2. Pricing is calculated in real-time with full breakdown
3. When trip is submitted, the complete pricing breakdown is saved to:
   - `pricing_breakdown_data` - Full JSON with all details
   - `pricing_breakdown_total` - Just the total amount
   - `pricing_breakdown_locked_at` - Timestamp of when it was saved

### **On Trip Details Page:**
1. System checks if trip has saved pricing breakdown
2. If saved data exists: Shows detailed breakdown with "Pricing Locked" badge
3. If no saved data: Shows legacy fallback with total only + informational message
4. Download function uses saved pricing data for detailed receipts
