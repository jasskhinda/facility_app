# üéØ WHEELCHAIR PRICING IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Successfully implemented **$25 wheelchair surcharge** for both foldable and power wheelchairs in the Compassionate Rides booking system.

## üõ†Ô∏è CHANGES MADE

### **1. Updated Pricing Logic** (`/lib/pricing.js`)

**Fixed wheelchair type detection:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only checked for 'wheelchair'
if (wheelchairType === 'wheelchair') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR;
}

// AFTER: Correctly checks for both wheelchair types
if (wheelchairType === 'foldable' || wheelchairType === 'power') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR; // $25
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Booking Form UI** (`/app/components/StreamlinedBookingForm.js`)

**Updated dropdown options to show pricing:**
```html
<option value="no_wheelchair">No wheelchair</option>
<option value="foldable">Foldable wheelchair +$25</option>
<option value="power">Power wheelchair +$25</option>
```
