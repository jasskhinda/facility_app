# üéØ WHEELCHAIR RENTAL PRICING - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ TASK SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

Updated the CCT facility app to correctly implement wheelchair rental pricing logic that distinguishes between:
- **Bringing your own wheelchair** = **No additional fee**
- **Wheelchair rental from CCT** = **$25 rental fee**

---

## üîß CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Updated Pricing Logic** (`lib/pricing.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Charged fee for any wheelchair type
if (wheelchairType === 'foldable' || wheelchairType === 'power') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only charge fee when CCT provides wheelchair (rental)
if (wheelchairType === 'provided') {
  breakdown.wheelchairPremium = PRICING_CONFIG.PREMIUMS.WHEELCHAIR;
}
```

### 2. **Updated Component Logic** (`app/components/WheelchairSelectionFlow.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Charged fee for any wheelchair selection
const hasValidWheelchair = (wheelchairType !== 'none' && wheelchairType !== 'transport') || needsWheelchair;
const hasWheelchairFee = hasValidWheelchair;
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only charge fee when CCT provides wheelchair
const hasWheelchairFee = needsWheelchair; // Only true when "Yes, please provide a wheelchair"
```
