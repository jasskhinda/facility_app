### ✅ **Client Management - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **Booking Form:** Shows both authenticated and managed clients with clear labeling
- **Trip Creation:** Properly handles both client types
- **Client Creation:** API-driven with full validation

## 🔧 FINAL TECHNICAL CHANGES

### **Critical Fixes Applied:**

1. **Route Handler Pattern (15 files updated)**
   ```javascript
   // Fixed async pattern for Next.js 15
   export async function GET(request, { params }) {
     const { id } = await params; // ✅ Now awaited
     const supabase = await createRouteHandlerClient(); // ✅ Now awaited
   }
   ```

2. **Client Loading in Booking Form**
   ```javascript
   // Now loads both client types via unified API
   const response = await fetch('/api/facility/clients');
   const allClients = data.clients
     .filter(client => client.client_type === 'authenticated' ? client.status === 'active' : true)
     .map(client => ({
       ...client,
       display_name: `${client.first_name} ${client.last_name}${client.client_type === 'managed' ? ' (Managed)' : ''}`
     }));
   ```

3. **Trip Creation Logic**
   ```javascript
   // Handles both client types properly
   if (selectedClientData?.client_type === 'managed') {
     tripData.managed_client_id = formData.clientId;
     tripData.user_id = null;
   } else {
     tripData.user_id = formData.clientId;
     tripData.managed_client_id = null;
   }
   ```
